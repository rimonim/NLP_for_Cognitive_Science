The Minecraft Dialogue Corpus [(Narayan-Chen et al., 2019)](http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/P19-1537) is a collection of 509 text-based conversations between players collaborating to build structures. The task was inspired by the Map Task; the "Architect" is shown a target structure and needs to explain to the "Builder" how to build it. The Architect can observe the Builder but cannot place blocks. 

For now, I am using this corpus as practice to learn Bayesian statistics as I go through [Statistical Rethinking, by Richard McElreath](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022) with its wonderful [brms/tidyverse translation by A Solomon Kurz](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/).
