> Builder: Now what?
> 
> Architect: cool! extend the top purple block to a row of 5 purple blocks
> 
> Architect: so like an upside down "L"
> 
> Builder: So they should extend to one side, correct?
> 
> Architect: yep!
> 
> Architect: nice! now, put a block above and below the second block from the right
> 
> Builder: What color should those blocks be?
>
